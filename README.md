# Pascal

Pascal is a bot that can handle youtube audio streaming over Discord, and temp channels. 

Users can ask for music using `!music <something>`. They can directly set the URL of a YouTube vidÃ©o, or keywords that will be sent to the search engine of YouTube. 

Users can be temporarily banned automatically for bad behavior (ex. using the command without being in the voice channel).
